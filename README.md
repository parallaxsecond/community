# Community ðŸŒ±

Community repository for all Parsec projects. This repository contains community-related ressources
such as meeting minutes.

## Community Channel

Come and talk to us in our **Slack Channel**! It is made for you to ask any question you would have
ðŸ˜ƒ.

We are on the `#parsec` channel in the CNCF Slack Workspace.

- You will first need to create an account on the [CNCF Slack Workspace](https://slack.cncf.io/)
- Then you can find and join the `#parsec` channel on the left pan or click [this
   link](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01EARH2ZB3).

## Community Meeting

Join the **bi-weekly meeting** with Parsec maintainers and community members. The meeting is open to
the public and everyone is encouraged to attend. We will use the time to discuss features,
integrations, issues, and roadmap. We look forward to seeing you all.

If you would like to discuss specific items during the meeting, please feel free to add them in the
[agenda](https://hackmd.io/@hug-dev/parsec/edit). You can for example link specific GitHub issues if
you would like to discuss them.

We will be polling the Slack channel for topics before each meeting if no items exist on the agenda,
and some meetings will be cancelled as a result. Thus, be sure to track the Slack channel if you're
interested in joining us!
